        Aditya is usually found in cities. His head appears small in comparison with
        the size of his body, which is generally covered in a hoodie and sweatpants.
        He has long lanky limbs which are useful for picking fruit off trees, and
        reaching the top shelves in the kitchen. His diet consists mainly of yogurt, 
        fruit, cooked meat, and chocolate. He has shaggy black hair that protects his 
        eyes from the sun.  Aditya is not able to pull his head into his shell.

          Hug Machine
          <br />
          <br />
          I chose hug machine, which is a game where you are prompted to hug a mannequin. The game prompts you to 
          hug in a certain way and based on whether you do the 'right' hug it marks you as right or wrong. The mannequin
          itself is the controller and can tell where you are hugging it based on what I'd assume is some kind of pressure
          sensor or button.
          <br />
          <br />
          I chose this controller because I think the concept of using something vaguely human shaped as a controller
          fascinating. And the focus seems to be on human touch which is something I'd like to explore. 
          <br />
          <br />
          For my sensor/game, I wanted to use the magnet sensors and a puck shaped magnet. And you flick the magnet towards the sensor 
          which is embedded into a tiny goal. Based on the speed and position it controls the swing for a game called cursed to golf.
          The position of the swing is based on the position of the magnet and the power is based on the speed.

        <div class="post-title-date">03.11.22 LED Double Trouble</div>
        <div class="text-container">
          The task at hand was to create a circuit where you repeatedly pressed a 
          button to turn in two leds in a cyclical sequence; 
          both leds off, one led on, both leds on.
          <!-- Use two line breaks <br /> to create a new paragraph -->
          <br />
          <br />
          The leds needed to be connected to digital pins in OUTPUT mode 
          so that they could be turned HIGH or LOW from the arduino. 
          And had to pass through a resistor to reduce the current. 
          <br />
          <br />
          The button needed to be connected to the arduino digital in INPUT
          mode and needed to be connected to a 10k ohm pulldown/pullup resistor.
