          My initial idea was to create a reactive sculpture using muscle wire, in the shape of a blob. With the goal of creating something that clearly doesn't look organic but behaves and moves organically. 
          <br />
          Working with muscle wire was challenging, the length and thickness of the wire affects it's resistance and strength so you need to be precise in measuring and cutting to size. Also the wire is super thin so I wasn't able to measure the resistance or current flowing through the wire without crimping it first. Which meant getting the right size of wire required a lot of cutting, crimping, trial and error. 
          <br />
          Once I tested everything, I found that the wire wasn't quite strong enough to pull a material and cause it to bend in the blob shape I desired. I think if I had more knowledge of material science, I would have been able to find a material that would have given me the desired effect but I don't so my tests failed. I tried out different shapes and I found that creating a loop makes the wire push out in an interesting way and it might be strong enough to lift up a light fabric.
          <br />      
          I laid out the wires in a grid of loops and connected all the electronics. And it was able to lift up a small square of fabric/tissue. At this point it was getting close to the deadline so I had to start finalizing the project so with the help of my friends (thanks Agata and Burak) I made a breadboard and soldered on all the electronics so that I had a standalone disc that contained the whole piece. 
          <br />
          The fact that the robot moved in complete silence inspired the way I had it interact with the world. Firstly I found the way that the wires moved when you cycled feeding it current mesmerizing. It looked like it was breathing, so I gave it deep breath and shallow breath movement patterns. I had it default to the deep breath movement and added a sound sensor so that when it detected a loud noise it would switch to the shallow fast breathing until the noise died down. The sound sensor data was pretty noisy (hah) so I ended up using the mic that was built into the arduino nano instead.
          <br />
          Ultimately I found that the movement when the fabric was on top of the mesh to be too subtle so I decided to just leave it exposed. Things didn't go as planned with this project but I do enjoy seeing it breathe so I'll take it.

          I used a pot and a bend sensor to make weird eyes in processing.
          
          Arduino Code:

  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  pot = analogRead(A3);
  bend = analogRead(A2);
  Serial.print(pot);
  Serial.print(',');
  Serial.println(bend);
  delay(20);
}

          Processing Code:

            <code>

          Hug Machine
          <br />
          <br />
          I chose hug machine, which is a game where you are prompted to hug a mannequin. The game prompts you to 
          hug in a certain way and based on whether you do the 'right' hug it marks you as right or wrong. The mannequin
          itself is the controller and can tell where you are hugging it based on what I'd assume is some kind of pressure
          sensor or button.
          <br />
          <br />
          I chose this controller because I think the concept of using something vaguely human shaped as a controller
          fascinating. And the focus seems to be on human touch which is something I'd like to explore. 
          <br />
          <br />
          For my sensor/game, I wanted to use the magnet sensors and a puck shaped magnet. And you flick the magnet towards the sensor 
          which is embedded into a tiny goal. Based on the speed and position it controls the swing for a game called cursed to golf.
          The position of the swing is based on the position of the magnet and the power is based on the speed.

        <div class="text-container">
          The task at hand was to create a circuit where you repeatedly pressed a 
          button to turn in two leds in a cyclical sequence; 
          both leds off, one led on, both leds on.
          <!-- Use two line breaks <br /> to create a new paragraph -->
          <br />
          <br />
          The leds needed to be connected to digital pins in OUTPUT mode 
          so that they could be turned HIGH or LOW from the arduino. 
          And had to pass through a resistor to reduce the current. 
          <br />
          <br />
          The button needed to be connected to the arduino digital in INPUT
          mode and needed to be connected to a 10k ohm pulldown/pullup resistor.
