      <div class="student-name">Aditya Radhakrishna</div>
      <div class="student-bio">
        Lifespan: 70 yrs
        Top Speed: 16 km/h
        Weight: 70 kg
        Height: 183 cm
        Aditya is usually found in cities. His head appears small in comparison with
        the size of his body, which is generally covered in a hoodie and sweatpants.
        He has long lanky limbs which are useful for picking fruit off trees, and
        reaching the top shelves in the kitchen. His diet consists mainly of yogurt, 
        fruit, cooked meat, and chocolate. He has shaggy black hair that protects his 
        eyes from the sun. Aditya is not able to pull his head into his shell.

          The task at hand was to create a circuit where you repeatedly pressed a 
          button to turn in two leds in a cyclical sequence; 
          both leds off, one led on, both leds on.
          <!-- Use two line breaks <br /> to create a new paragraph -->
          <br />
          <br />
          The leds needed to be connected to digital pins in OUTPUT mode 
          so that they could be turned HIGH or LOW from the arduino. 
          And had to pass through a resistor to reduce the current. 
          <br />
          <br />
          The button needed to be connected to the arduino digital in INPUT
          mode and needed to be connected to a 10k ohm pulldown/pullup resistor.
